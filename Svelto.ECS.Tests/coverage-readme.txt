Usage:
1. Install ReportGenerator as a global tool:
   C:\> dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
2. Run coverage.bat
   - this will create a "reports" directory with a file "coverage.cobertura.xml" generated by coverlet,
     and a "reportsviz" directory with a static website containing the coverage report generated
     by ReportGenerator
3. Open "reportsviz/index.html" in a browser to view and browse coverage information
